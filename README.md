s# Cisco VLAN Project

Designed and implemented a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer with one router, one switch, and three PCs. Configured inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between VLANs and verified connectivity using ping tests. This project demonstrates foundational networking concepts and practical troubleshooting techniques.

## **Configuration Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Network Topology**
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Add the following devices:
   - **1 Router** (Cisco 2911).
   - **1 Switch** (Cisco 2960).
   - **3 PCs**:
3. Connect devices using appropriate cables:
   - PCs to the switch using straight-through cables.
   - Switch to the router using a straight-through cable.
